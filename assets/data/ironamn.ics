SUMMARY:Bike: 2h Endurance Ride
DESCRIPTION:Ride at an easy/steady intensity\, mainly in Z2 today. You shou
 ld be able to chat at this intensity. This ride will improve your efficien
 cy for using fat for fuel and increase your ability to transport oxygen to 
 your working muscles.\n`- - - -\nPhil’s Training Tip:\n\nWhen you're exerc
 ising for longer than about 1 hour 20 you need to consume carbohydrate dur
 ing your workouts to stop your energy levels from dropping too much. Aim f
 or the equivalent of an energy gel every 30 minutes for training. It doesn
 't even have to be an "energy" product. You could have a cereal bar\, a ba
 nana\, a sugary drink or whatever you like. It just needs to consist mainl
 y of carbohydrate. And water is fine for hydration.\n- - - -\nImported wit

 ning Tip:\n\nYour pace on these runs will depend on several factors\, such 
 as the terrain\, elevation and conditions. Try not to get too worried abou
 t sticking to a set pace. Heart Rate or Rate of Perceived Exertion can wor

 out. Think in weeks and months\, rather than day-to-day. Don't get too foc
 used on good days or bad days or over-analysing your short term data. Thin

 Tip:\n\nDon't panic if you cannot complete 100% of your workouts. Do your 
 best to stick to your plan\, while accepting that occasionally life gets i
 n the way. Following a plan will help you train more effectively than not 
 having a plan at all. Do your best with whatever time and resources you ha
 ve\, and don't give up. Don't worry about one bad week\, it’s what you do 
 consistently over a period of months that counts.\n- - - -\nImported with

 nPhil’s Training Tip:\nYour "cadence" is the count of how many pedal revol
 utions you do per minute. Whereas\, "power output" is a combination of you
 r cadence AND how hard you pedal. Therefore\, to increase your power outpu
 t you would need to pedal faster in the same gear. Or pedal at the same ca
 dence\, but in a bigger gear.\n\nWhat's the Best Cadence?\nResearch is unc
 lear on the single "best cadence" to ride at. One study suggests that athl
 etes subconsciously self-select the cadence that's most efficient at a giv
 en time. The best cadence for your needs can also depend on the type of cy
 clist you are\, your aerobic fitness\, physique\, leg strength and exercis
 e intensity. For example\, your cadence might naturally be higher in a rac
 e\, and lower during an easy training ride.\n\nWhat Cadence to Target?\n85
 -90 rpm is ideal for many riders\, but don't force yourself to ride at tha
 t cadence if it doesn't feel right. Try not to get too worried about your 
 cadence - it may naturally change over time anyway. You're better off focu
 sing on increasing your power output and reducing your aerodynamic drag.\n

 Tip:\n\nDon't feel you need to do all your workouts alone. If you enjoy do
 ing club or group workouts\, you can still incorporate these into your tra
 ining plan. In fact\, it's a good idea. Just make sure that your group wor
 kouts replace similar types of workouts from your training plan. For examp
 le\, you might swap solo speed work for a group/coached session. Or an aer
 obic endurance workout can be done with your club/team or workout buddies.

 nique Focus:\nDriving the Thigh.\n\nConcentrate on driving the thigh of yo
 ur swing leg forward a little more forcefully than you normally do. The mo
 re forceful forward/upward movement of this leg will create a counterbalan
 cing downward/backward action in your opposite leg as it comes into contac
 t with the ground. (Think of the way your free arm moves in opposition to 
 your throwing arm when you throw a ball hard.)\nFeel free to concentrate o
 n driving only one thigh throughout a workout or\, if you can manage it\, 
 to concentrate on driving both thighs. (The average stride rate being in e
 xcess of 150 per minute\, it can be difficult to focus your attention prop
 erly on both legs when using this proprioceptive cue). This cue will help 
 you refine the coordinated timing of movements between your two legs and e
 nhance your stride stiffness.\n- - - -\nImported with tp2intervals (https:
